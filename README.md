# Phishnet

Phishnet is a web application that detects if the user is being directed to a phishing site. It does this by comparing the domain name of the current site to a list of known phishing sites. If the domain name is found in the list, the user is alerted and given the option to go to the site anyway. It is built using the [Chrome Extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index), Python, [MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/). Please send a feedback if you find any bugs or the extension is not working as expected and suggestions for improvement.
